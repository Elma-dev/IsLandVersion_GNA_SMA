# IsLandVersion_GNA_SMA
```
Another approach to implementing GNA utilizing a distributed system is theIsLand Version of GNA in System Multi Agents.
This approach works really well and produces results.
With this approach, we divide the problem into smaller ones and have each agent try to come up with the best solution.
The working approach is different between this method and the first one (https://github.com/Elma-dev/GA_using_SMA) (see the schema).
